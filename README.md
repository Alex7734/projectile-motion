I just made physics in python using pygame to visualize it. You can change em constants but the idea is that it works with real physics.

How to use ? Well | pip install -r requirements.txt | and than | python projectile-motion.py | these should do the trick :3 

PS: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON AND PIP INSTALLED AND IN YOUR OS PATHS!!!
